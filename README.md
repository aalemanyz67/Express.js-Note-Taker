# Objective
Create an application using Express.js that allows the user to take down and save notes.

# Description
Using Express.js, I was able to create an application in which the user has the ability to use a note taker. This application can be used as a grocery list, a to do list, an organization list, etc.

# Installation
A user can access the application by clicking on my application link.
Once the browser has opened the application, the user can click the "Get Started" button. Once the next "notes" page has loaded, the user can then click on the "note title" and create a new title for their list. Next, the user can then click on  "note text" to type their information. From there, the user can click on the "Save" icon to save thier new note. Lastly the user can click on the plus (+) sign to create a new note.

# Usage and Future Improvements
This application can be used as a note taker for multiple purposes. In the future, I want to make the delete icon functional so that notes that are no longer needed can be deleted.
